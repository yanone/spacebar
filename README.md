# Space Bar

![Space Bar screenshot](./screenshot.png)

Space Bar is a plug-in for the popular type design application Glyphs.app
that gives you a lot more insight into the spacing and other metrics of your font.
It is particularly handy for working on a font with multiple masters.

The tool visualizes metrics values that cannot otherwise be seen while editing.
Because you’re working on a master, you can’t see how your changes play out across all your defined instances.
