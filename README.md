This repository hosts Yanone’s plug-in for [Glyphs.app](https://glyphsapp.com).

# Space Bar

![Space Bar screenshot](./screenshot.png)

Space Bar is a plug-in for the popular type design application Glyphs.app
that gives you a lot more insight into the spacing and other metrics of your font.
It is particularly handy for working on a font with multiple masters.

The tool visualizes metrics values that cannot otherwise be seen while editing.
Because you’re working on a master, you can’t see how your changes play out across all your defined instances.

v1.01 (June 2017): Reaction on API changes in Glyphs 2.4.2
This version of Space Bar is *not* backward-compatible with the stable Glyphs.app version 2.4.1, eventhough this should have been possible. It is intended for the latest Cutting Edge versions of 2.4.2 (at least build number 1035 as of this writing, maybe older ones, too) and will be compatible with the upcoming stable release of 2.4.2.
